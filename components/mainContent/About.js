    <h2>What About Me?</h2>
    <p>I am a designer by fate. I like to find the beauty in all things. With the wave of the future being technology driven, it's my hope that I can marry my design abilties with my new skills in web development.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love to draw. If I could have "dream time" spent doing whatever I wanted, it would probably be visiting vintage shops and a day at the farmer's market. That day would probably end with a good movie on the sofa. That's something I don't get to go often.</p>
